# VL.DlibDotNet

Some parts of [DlibDotNet](https://github.com/takuya-takeuchi/DlibDotNet) library ported to VL.

Needs DlibDotNet.CUDA100 nuget:

`nuget install DlibDotNet.CUDA100 -Version 19.18.0.20200301`

or just click "Install" in the document.

# Note:

Requires Cuda 10.0 to be installed.
Should work without cuda as well - you need to reference to DlibDotNet (without cuda) and rebuild source project. - I haven't check it.
