# VL.DlibDotNet

Some parts of [DlibDotNet](https://github.com/takuya-takeuchi/DlibDotNet) library ported to VL.

Install:

`nuget install vl.dlibdotnet -pre`


# Note:

Requires [Cuda 10.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64) and [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) to be installed (nvidia developer is needed).
Should work with others cuda versions and without cuda as well - you need to reference the right DlibDotNet version and rebuild source project. - I haven't try it yet.
